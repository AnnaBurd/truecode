## Completion Notes

The project has been completed according to the specifications outlined in the task. The layout is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes. Animations have been implemented as described in the animation guide, and the provided video has been integrated successfully into the text "Mars". The layout has been tested and confirmed to function properly in the specified browsers.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Missing Fonts:** The font used in the design didn't support Cyrillic characters. I had to find and apply a compatible font with minimal stylistic differences. Initially, I tried a hack by imitating Russian letters with Latin characters, like using "MAPS" instead of "–ú–∞—Ä—Å".

2. **No Framer Motion:** I'm used to implementing animations smoothly with React and Framer Motion. Working without them meant relying solely on CSS keyframes, which can be more time-consuming.

3. **Pixel-Perfect Layout:** I have limited experience with pixel-perfect layouts. To ensure accuracy, I used a browser extension called PerfectPixel to compare the layout with the Figma design and make adjustments where needed.
